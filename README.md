## Todolist App
In order to learn the basics of Kotlin, I decided to make a to-do list application that works on the console. This application expects the user to enter a task. In addition, the user can edit the existing tasks or print them collectively. Colors are printed in the output according to the priority and date of the task.

## What I learned
* Datetime
* List
* Try-Catch-Exception
* Extencion Function
* Object
